# Prework Study Guide 3 Webpage

## Description

This is my Prework Study Guide after 4 attemps. Although I compleated the project on my third attempt I wanted to start all over again and refresh my skills.  After many years of being in the food and beverage industry I have decided to change careers.  I built this project, not only as part of an assignment but to learn the skills neccessary for my new adventure.  This website has a few tidbits of what HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript bring to the table.  Through this entire assignment I have learned to be patient. This adventure can at times be very frustrating but keeping an open mind and rereading your code thoughly helps you solve the bugs. I am looking forward to these next 24 weeks.

## Usage

This study guide give you a small sample of each language we have learned so far in this course. HTML is the body of the page where you can add style and function to your site.  HTML is like the frame of your house.  CSS is your design element. With CSS you can add color, pictures, boarders and padding to your text. JavaScript adds function to your website. It enables you to interact with the website.  Git pulls it all together and keeps it organized in one database. Evertime you fix a line of code or add something to the code you need to send it to Git by using a few commands. It is quite facinating.
